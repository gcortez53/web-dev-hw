    <h2>Why choose compound bows?</h2>
    <p>I chose to do my project on how to shoot a compound bow because they have been a huge part of my life.
    Ever since I was young, I would read comics about Green Arrow and would
  be amazed at how fun it would be to shoot one for fun. Fast forward in time and I started to hunt with a compound bow.
Ever since then, I have been in love with bows and spend tons of time out practicing or hunting with them. TV shows like Arrow and Hawkeye have further
increased my love for them!</p>
