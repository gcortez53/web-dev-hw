    <h1>Obi-Wan Kenobi vs. Anakin Skywalker</h1>
    <h2>Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (2005)</h2>
    <p>By George Lucas</p>
  </div>

    <div class="text">
      <p>Obi-Wan: Let her go, Anakin! Let her go!</p>
      <p>Anakin: You turned her against me!</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan: You have done that yourself.</p>
      <p>Anakin: You will not take her from me!</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan: You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind, until now...Until now, you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.</p>
      <p>Anakin: Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the Dark Side as you do!</p>
      <p>Anakin: I have brought peace, freedom, justice and security to my new Empire.</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan: Your new Empire?</p>
      <p>Anakin: Don't make me kill you.</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!</p>
      <p>Anakin: If you're not with me, then you are my enemy.</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan: Only a Sith deals in absolutes. *grabbing his lightsaber* I will do what I must.</p>
      <p>Anakin: You will try.</p>
      <p>***Lightsaber Fight sequence***</p>
      <p>After fighting furiously throughout the Mustafar Lava Compound, Obi-Wan lands himself on a hovering platform in the middle of a lava stream, with Anakin directly in front, staring at him with hatred.</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan: Anakin, I have failed you.</p>
      <p>Anakin: I should've known the Jedi were plotting to take over!</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan: Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!</p>
      <p>Anakin: From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan: Well, then, you are lost!</p>
      <p>***Anakin comes up alongside Obi-Wan's hovering platform***</p>
      <p>Anakin: This is the end for you, my Master.</p>
      <p>***Obi-Wan leaps from the platform and onto a rocky hill***</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan: It's over, Anakin! I have the high ground.</p>
      <p>Anakin: You under-estimate my power!</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan: Don't try it!</p>
      <p>***Anakin attempts to overshoot Obi-Wan on the hill, but when he flys over Obi-Wan's head, he get's sliced in two by his lightsaber. He then tumbles down the hill near the lava stream***</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan, upon seeing what he's done: You were the Chosen One! It was said you would destroy the Sith, not join them! Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!</p>
      <p>Anakin, lying on the ground: I hate you!</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you!</p>
      <p>Those were the final words spoken by Obi-Wan on Mustafar. Anakin's body was too closen to the lava, and as a result, it burst into flames.</p>
      <p>Obi-Wan couldn't bear to watch his padawan burn, and walks away.</p>
